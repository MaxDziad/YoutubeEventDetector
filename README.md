# YoutubeEventDetector
Hello! Welcome to my YoutubeEventDetector project.
It's an application I made for my final Bachelor's Degree project.

Purpose: collect occurred events from user YouTube sessions

Events: pausing video, resuming video, connection interruption, skipping video, changing video, turning on/off fullscreen

Input: collection of .mp4 videos

Output: list of plain strings defining all occurred events and their apperance time

NOTE: application concept is based on a Finite State-Machine. Unexpected behaviours such as leaving YouTube page will produce invalid information.
Consider only video inputs, which contains only recorded YouTube sessions.

For more detailed informations, download and look through Prezentacja_do_obrony.pptx presentation file (PL).
